"""RAG vertical workflows.

This package provides workflow definitions for common RAG tasks using
YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex conditions.

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- document_ingest: Document ingestion with parsing, chunking, and embedding
- incremental_update: Update existing index with new/modified documents
- rag_query: Answer questions using retrieved context with citations
- conversation: Multi-turn RAG conversation with context persistence
- agentic_rag: RAG with agentic reasoning and tool use
- maintenance: Index maintenance and optimization

Example:
    provider = RAGWorkflowProvider()

    # Compile and execute (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("rag_query", {"query": "How does X work?"})

    # Stream execution with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("rag_query", context):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

Usage:
    from victor_rag.workflows import RAGWorkflowProvider

    provider = RAGWorkflowProvider()

    # List available workflows
    print(provider.get_workflow_names())

    # Get a specific workflow definition
    workflow = provider.get_workflow("rag_query")

    # Execute with caching
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("rag_query", {"query": "..."})
