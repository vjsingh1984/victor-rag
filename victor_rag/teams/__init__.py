"""Teams integration for RAG vertical.

This package provides team specifications for common RAG tasks with
rich persona attributes for natural agent characterization.

Example:
    from victor_rag.teams import (
        get_team_for_task,
        RAG_TEAM_SPECS,
    )

    # Get team for a task type
    team_spec = get_team_for_task("search")
    print(f"Team: {team_spec.name}")
    print(f"Members: {len(team_spec.members)}")

Teams are auto-registered with the global TeamSpecRegistry on import,
enabling cross-vertical team discovery via:
    from victor_contracts.team_schema import get_runtime_team_registry as get_team_registry
    registry = get_team_registry()
    rag_teams = registry.find_by_vertical("rag")
